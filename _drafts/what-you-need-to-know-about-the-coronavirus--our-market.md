As of late, the coronavirus has caused global uncertainty and a U.S. stock market correction that no one saw coming—not to mention the impact it’s had on lives and families around the world.&nbsp;

With all of this uncertainty, how do you make a powerful, confident decision regarding your real estate plans? The National Association of Realtors believes that, at the very least, it could cause some people to put their real estate plans on hold. While this is an understandable approach, **it’s important to balance how it may cost you in the long run.&nbsp;**

For example, periods of international crisis tend to cause lower mortgage interest rates as investors flee stocks for the safety of U.S. bonds. At the moment, mortgage rates are around 3%, which is a historic low. I’ve been in the business for 20 years, and I’ve never seen rates this low.&nbsp;

We haven’t seen the full impact of the coronavirus on the housing market, so I encourage you to **review your real estate plans and meet with a professional who can walk you through the steps you must take to achieve your goals.&nbsp;**

When I first became an agent, my father-in-law taught me how to hone in on my goals and focus on the various paths I could take to achieve them, and I want to offer you the same guidance. Get in touch with me and I’d be happy to discuss how to reach your real estate goals. We can formulate a strategy to help you navigate any market and take care of all your needs.&nbsp;

If you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’m here to help.&nbsp;
