First-time homebuyers: How much cash do you need to close on your first home? Well, when you go through the purchasing process **your mortgage lender will look at several pieces of information to determine how much money you’ll need,** such as your income and credit history. The great news is that many programs can help you pay for your down payment and closing costs.
