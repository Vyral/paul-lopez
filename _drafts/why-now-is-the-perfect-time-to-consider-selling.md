{% include youtube.html %} This may be the best time for you to sell your home in quite some time.

In case you haven’t heard already, 2020 may be the best time for you to sell your home. Inventory has dropped to its lowest level since 1982. With historically low interest rates, now is one of the most advantageous times to consider selling. We’ve seen home values increase by an average of 7.8% over the last year, which is the largest increase in the last four years. Putting your home on the market now can result in a quick, easy home sale for a premium price.
