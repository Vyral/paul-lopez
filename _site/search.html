Find out what brings meaning to the activities that you do every day like showing up to your job and prospecting, and how it all brings meaning to your purpose. When you look at your purpose, how does that relate to the goals you want to achieve in 2020? When it comes time to accomplish your goals, I encourage you to be truly present in your daily work.âFind out what brings meaning to the activities that you do every day.âFinally, if you know that youâre going to buy, sell, or invest in 2020, the time to start planning is now.

Whenever weâre together and 80s music comes on, a great sense of joy fills the air.Â I have another friend I donât get to see very often, but whenever I do see them, our conversations are so deep and meaningful. There is so much wisdom shared about our lives, our families, and everything we have in common.âI love helping families with their real estate needs.âMy dad is my greatest friend, and regardless of where I am in life, he has an extra special way of picking me up and encouraging me that the sky is the limit and there are endless opportunities for what I can do with my life.Â The point is, there are so many great opportunities around us that are so simple, and when we take a moment to look at the space around us and the wonderful things in our life, you can feel a sense of profound gratitude fill your day and give you a boost of energy.Â I love helping families with their real estate needs.

That makes right now the perfect time to start thinking about your goals for the new year and finish up some of your goals from 2019.If youâre doing any financial planning and thinking about refinancing or buying a home, you should know that interest rates are still incredibly low right now.

If not, itâs a good idea to do so now.âNow is a great time to check up on your current mortgage.âFinally, is your home ready to withstand the winter months?

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Whether youâre buying your very first home, selling your current home and buying another one, or are considering real estate as an investment strategy, your first order of business will be to organize your finances. There are three main steps you must take to do so.Â First, check your credit report. Whether you have perfect credit or your credit score needs work, you should take advantage of the many resources available to consumers such as yourself. Checking your credit doesnât affect your credit score, but itâs a great place to start because you can find out exactly whatâs being reported. And if you discover any errors, you have plenty of time to correct them.Â Second, consider where your down payment and closing costs are coming from (and remember that these are two separate things). Youâll want to know how much funds youâll have to work with and where youâll access these funds. Perhaps theyâll come from a savings account, or perhaps from a 401(k) or retirement plan. In the latter case, youâll want to talk to your funds advisor sooner rather than later so you can learn the rules for using that money for your home purchase. The same applies if youâve gone through a life-changing event (e.g., getting divorced or receiving an inheritance).âWhether you have perfect credit or your credit score needs work, you should take advantage of the many resources available to consumers such as yourself.âWhen it comes to organizing your finances, make sure you meet with an experienced mortgage professionalâone whoâll sit down with you and take the time to fully understand your financial situation and your prospective home purchase. Theyâll outline how much your down payment, closing costs, and monthly mortgage payments will be.Â Buying a home is an emotionally charged transaction, and there are many steps youâll go through to complete the transaction. With the right team behind you, though, this transaction can be seamless and quite enjoyable.Â If youâd like to know more about organizing your finances or you have any other real estate questions, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you.Â Â ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Are you considering selling your home and starting to realize what an emotional roller coaster it can be? You have to choose your broker, prepare your home for sale, and identify your new home all while life is still happening.This is where your real estate broker can bring calmness and clarity to an event that can be very stressful if not dealt with precisely. Here are several key areas that you should focus on as a home seller to create a clear home-selling strategy:1. Pricing your home. When it comes to pricing your home, you certainly donât want to go too high. Buyers and consumers can obtain all the information they need to find out what your home is actually worth. You wonât trick them by overpricing. When you bring all the data and info together, you can come up with a great price. Itâs also important to know how much money youâre going to walk away with in your pocket at the end of the day. After youâve determined pricing and your net cash and marketing plan, itâs time to get your home on the market.âMake sure your home can be seen at a momentâs notice.â2.

        "content": "When it comes time for your mortgage lender to submit your documentation to the underwriting department, it can take anywhere from three to four weeks for them to come up with a decision. When youâre going through this process, the lender may come back to you and ask for additional documentation or to resubmit prior documents. Keep in mind that youâre asking the bank to lend you a large amount of money and they want to get as much documentation as they need to process the loan, so please be patient and keep a good attitude through it all as this can be a lengthy process.Â Youâve taken a lot of time to research and carefully select the property you want to call home or a property that you want to invest in. Whatever the case may be, you want to make sure you take these four rules into account so your loan process goes as smooth as possible:1. Donât change employment. There are certain circumstances that come up where you feel that itâs time to leave your job and look for a new one. However, when your loan is in the underwriting process for the purchase of a home, stay exactly where you are financially until after closing.âLarge purchases could result in the denial of your loan.â2. Avoid using your credit cards as much as possible. At the same time, donât close any cards or open up any new lines of credit. Itâs not a good idea.3. Avoid making any large purchases. It can be tempting to buy a new car or new furniture if you need it, but it should be avoided until after the loan is funded. These purchases could result in the denial of your loan or the end of your transaction.4. Donât open, close, or transfer bank accounts. Your loan officer has already taken your current financial picture into consideration, so itâs wise to keep it exactly where it is through the underwriting process. This underwriting time frame can be difficult to deal with, but in the end, itâs a very rewarding experience.If you have any questions for me about the mortgage process or about real estate in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "As a homebuyer, what steps must you take to ensure you find the right home for you and your family?First, choose an experienced Real Estate Broker to work with. Itâs important to start with this task because a good Real Estate Broker will help formulate your strategy. When it comes to buying a home, no two scenarios are exactly alike, which means thereâs no one-size-fits-all solution. Your Real Estate Broker will guide you through the process, remind you of your original objectives, and make sure you meet them.Â When it comes to selecting a home to purchase, I recommend thinking of it as a process of elimination. You donât want to miss out on anything available, so begin by identifying which cities you want to live in. This will narrow down to several different factors, including your buying power, budget, and the location of these cities with respect to your daily commute.Â After youâve settled on one city, narrow your focus further to the neighborhoods of that city. This will be determined by factors such as school districts, shopping centers, your work commute, etc.Â Once youâve decided on the neighborhoods youâd like to live in, itâs time to amp up your research, especially online. Youâll want to talk to different people who live in these neighborhoods to really get a sense of whether theyâre ideal for your family.Â âIâve employed this strategy for close to 20 years, and itâs one of the most effective ways to find a home that meets the needs of your family.âWhen youâve decided on a single neighborhood, itâs time to visit open houses in the area. Open houses are a great way to view homesâyou can spend as much time as you want looking around inside and considering all the amenities the home has to offer.Â Meanwhile, you should be communicating with your Real Estate Broker the information youâve discovered and how it applies to your situation. They can get different estimates for you and advise you on any neighborhood information thatâs not public information.Â After you talk to your Real Estate Broker, schedule in-person visits to the homes on your short list. You started big, but now youâve narrowed your search all the way down to the homes you may want to make an offer on. Itâs during this point your Realtor should remind you of your original objectives and make sure the homes you see in person will meet your needs.Â Iâve employed this strategy for close to 20 years, and itâs one of the most effective ways to find a home that meets the needs of your family.Â  After all is said and done, you and your Real Estate Broker will write a strong offer and, if itâs accepted, begin closing on your new home.Â If youâd like to talk more about the best home buying strategy for you or you have any other real estate needs I can take care of, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

Depending on where your property is located, each county in the area has its own customary practices for handling them.Â In some counties, itâs customary for the seller to obtain all the inspections prior to putting the home on the market. In other counties, itâs customary for the buyer to obtain the inspections once the property is already under contract and in the escrow period.Typically, there will be three to four necessary inspections:1. General home inspection2. Termite inspection3. Roof inspection4. Chimney inspection (if applicable)5. Pool inspection (if applicable)In the counties where these inspections are obtained prior to placing the home on the market, it provides a lot of good information on the sales price that is set for your home.

An appraisal is only required if a buyer is using financing to purchase a home. The goal of the appraiser is to make sure that the home meets the minimum value requirement for the type of financing that will be obtained.

        "author": "",

        "content": "When is truly the best time to buy a home? To answer this, Iâd like you to consider an old Chinese proverb: âThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the second best time is today.âÂ In short, the point is that thereâs no time like the present. If youâre thinking of buying a home, then now is the time to join millions of other Americans who have already taken the plunge into the homeownership dream.Â Itâs a proven fact that homeowners have an average net worth thatâs 44 times the net worth of the average renter. So while acquiring a mortgage may seem intimidating, the debt associated with a home purchase is actually good debt to have.Â Immediately after closing on a home, your finances may indeed be stretched. Once youâre settled in and get accustomed to homeownership, though, youâll be in a good position to start thinking about how to tackle your mortgage from a long-term perspective.Â As you think about your strategy for paying off this debt, there are a couple of key questions to consider. First, when do you plan to retire? Also, will you pay off other debts before your mortgage? And, finally, will you leverage your position as a homeowner to purchase investment properties? If so, how will you manage those debts.âWhether you already own a home or are just now considering a home purchase, thereâs no time like the present to evaluate your plan for paying off your mortgage.âNo two homeowners have the exact same goals or the exact same circumstances, so your approach to paying off your mortgage should be equally unique. This is precisely why I partner with people like you: Itâs my goal to help you pay off your mortgage, perhaps sooner than later, in a way also benefits the other aspirations you may have.Â There are seven general strategies Iâve outlined for paying off a mortgage before its full termâthe first of which is a simple, bi-weekly payment plan. Following this plan, homeowners are called to pay one half of their mortgage payment every two weeks. This equates to 26 total payments over the course of one year. Youâll actually end up paying the equivalent of a full extra mortgage payment after a 12-month periodâsomething that will save you tens of thousands of dollars and shave anywhere between six and eight years off the life of your mortgage.Â Another popular strategy is the 15-year mortgage plan. The current average rate for 15-year mortgages is around 3.5%. If youâve already lived in your home for a number of years, now could be the ideal time to refinance into a 15-year loan.Â Making one extra payment per quarter is also a good strategy for those looking to save time and money in paying off their mortgage.Â If youâd like to learn more about the strategies Iâve covered today, or about the four other strategies Iâve outlined, then please reach out.Â And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "When listing your home, the best way to prepare it for the market and make sure it gets sold quickly and for top dollar is to think like a buyer.Â To think like a buyer, you need to know that buyers are primarily concerned with three factors during their home search: price, location, and condition. Although you canât change your homeâs location, you can do something about its price and condition.Â When it comes to pricing your home, remember that youâre in a competitive situation. In other words, price it according to all of the other comparable homes on the market in your area that youâre competing against. If itâs in the $500,000 price range, how does it stack up against all the other homes in that price range with similar features?As far as condition goes, look at your home from both a structural and cosmetic standpoint. If you plan on selling within the next three to six months, think about your return on investment in terms of which repairs and upgrades to make. I wouldnât recommend spending tens of thousands of dollars on renovations; itâs better to make the kinds of improvements that will appeal to buyers in the shortest amount of time.Â âAlthough you canât change your homeâs location, you can do something about its price and condition.âThe best thing you can do to make sure your home is in top condition is to get it professionally cleaned. Buyers want to be able to visualize living in your home, and this allows them to do that. Cleaning your home for the market is a fine art and a developed skill, though, so make sure you hire a professional to do the job.If youâre worried that your home doesnât appeal to the buyers in our market, donât be. Thatâs where a Realtor such as myself comes into play. I can walk through your home, determine what its key selling points are, and develop a marketing plan to emphasize those points.Â If youâd like to schedule a walk-through appointment for your home or you have any other questions about how to sell it quickly and for top dollar, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Whether youâre a first-time homebuyer or a veteran homebuyer, there are a few tips you need to remember to make your purchase as smooth and seamless as possible from a financial perspective.Â First, consider your closing costs. If youâre a first-time homebuyer, you can get a mortgage loan that requires a down payment of as little as 3%, but you canât forget about your closing costs.Â As a rule of thumb, closing costs generally make up 3% to 5% of the price of the home. If your home costs $350,000, for instance, you should expect to pay at least $12,000 in closing costs. Since thatâs roughly the same amount as your down payment, youâd have to bring $24,000 in total to close on the home.Â âYou canât forget about your closing costs.âIf you enter into a purchase agreement and you donât have the necessary funds set aside for the closing costs, youâll find yourself at a competitive disadvantage because youâll have to ask for concessions from the seller.Â Second, make sure you know the homeâs true condition. The seller is required to disclose everything they know about the home, but oftentimes, they wonât know about any current defects, so finding out if there are any falls squarely on you.Â To do this, youâll need to order some inspections. For all of my clients, I recommend they order a home inspection, pest inspection, roof report, andâdepending on the homeâs amenitiesâa chimney or pool inspection. All of these will cost between $800 and $1,000, but the information you gain from them is well worth it.Â Finally, figure out how much cash youâll need to close. Along with the home inspection we mentioned earlier, there are a number of additional expenses homebuyers must expect as they prepare to seal the deal. These expenses will vary slightly, but, in general, will run you between 2% and 5% of the purchase price.If youâd like to know more about how to prepare for your home purchase, give me a call and Iâd be happy to schedule a free consultation that will guide you through the process step by step.Â If you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me as well.

			<p>Home sellers and buyers want relationship-building, strategic planning and tough negotiation from the real estate agent they select. Since 2001, I have brought these strengths to my clients and learned a lot about the industry. These big transactions can be an emotional process, and clients are happy to report that I bring the calmness and clarity needed to help them make the best decisions.</p>

<p>Iâve helped first-time home buyers and move-up buyers looking for their forever home. I have helped retirees, divorcees and investment buyers, and found a way to bring order to the chaos in every situation. I believe in taking the extra time up front to understand the whole familyâs needs before creating a plan. Equally important, Iâm aligned with a like-minded team that includes inspectors, lenders and title professionals who ensure the process is efficient and painless.</p>
