Are you considering selling your home and started to realize what an emotional rollercoaster it can be? From choosing your broker, to preparing your home for sale, and identifying your new home, all while life is still happening.

This is where your real estate broker can bring calmness and clarity to an event that can be very stressful if not dealt with precisely. **Here are several key areas that you should focus on as a home seller to create a clear home-selling strategy:**

**1\. Pricing your home.** When it comes to pricing your home, you certainly don’t want to go too high. Buyers and consumers can obtain all the information they need to find out what your home is actually worth. You won’t trick them by overpricing. When you bring all the data and info together, you can come up with a great price. It’s also important to know how much money you’re going to walk away with in your pocket at the end of the day. After you’ve determined pricing and your net cash and marketing plan, it’s time to get your home on the market.

**2\. Showing availability.** Make sure your home can be seen at a moment’s notice. Buyers looking at your home could be from out of the area without the time to schedule a perfect appointment, but you should do everything you can to accommodate them. It can be stressful to have your home perfect all the time, but make it as a viewable as possible to help out.

**3\. Hire a real estate broker you trust.** This person should understand your expectations and be a team leader.&nbsp;
