When is truly the best time to buy a home? To answer this, I’d like you to consider an old Chinese proverb: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the second best time is today.” 

In short, the point is that there’s no time like the present. If you’re thinking of buying a home, then now is the time to join millions of other Americans who have already taken the plunge into the homeownership dream. 

It’s a proven fact that homeowners have an average net worth that’s 44 times the net worth of the average renter. So while acquiring a mortgage may seem intimidating, **the debt associated with a home purchase is actually good debt to have. **

Immediately after closing on a home, your finances may indeed be stretched. Once you’re settled in and get accustomed to homeownership, though, you’ll be in a good position to start thinking about how to tackle your mortgage from a long-term perspective. 

As you think about your strategy for paying off this debt, there are a couple of key questions to consider. First, when do you plan to retire? Also, will you pay off other debts before your mortgage? And, finally, will you leverage your position as a homeowner to purchase investment properties? If so, how will you manage those debts.

No two homeowners have the exact same goals or the exact same circumstances, so your approach to paying off your mortgage should be equally unique. This is precisely why I partner with people like you: It’s my goal to help you pay off your mortgage, perhaps sooner than later, in a way also benefits the other aspirations you may have. 

**There are seven general strategies I’ve outlined for paying off a mortgage before its full term—the first of which is a simple, bi-weekly payment plan.** Following this plan, homeowners are called to pay one half of their mortgage payment every two weeks. This equates to 26 total payments over the course of one year. You’ll actually end up paying the equivalent of a full extra mortgage payment after a 12-month period—something that will save you tens of thousands of dollars and shave anywhere between six and eight years off the life of your mortgage. 

Another popular strategy is the 15-year mortgage plan. The current average rate for 15-year mortgages is around 3.5%. If you’ve already lived in your home for a number of years, now could be the ideal time to refinance into a 15-year loan. 

Making one extra payment per quarter is also a good strategy for those looking to save time and money in paying off their mortgage.
