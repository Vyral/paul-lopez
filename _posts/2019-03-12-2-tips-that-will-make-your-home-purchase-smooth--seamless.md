Whether you’re a first-time homebuyer or a veteran homebuyer, there are a couple of tips you need to remember to make your purchase as smooth and seamless as possible from a financial perspective.&nbsp;

First, **consider your closing costs**. If you’re a first-time homebuyer, you can get a mortgage loan that requires a down payment of as little as 3%, but you can’t forget about your closing costs.&nbsp;

As a rule of thumb, closing costs generally make up 3% to 5% of the price of the home. If your home costs $350,000, for instance, you should expect to pay at least $12,000 in closing costs. Since that’s roughly the same amount as your down payment, you’d have to bring $24,000 in total to close on the home.&nbsp;

If you enter into a purchase agreement and you don’t have the necessary funds set aside for the closing costs, you’ll find yourself at a competitive disadvantage because you’ll have to ask for concessions from the seller.&nbsp;

Second, **make sure you know the home’s true condition**. The seller is required to disclose everything they know about the home, but oftentimes, they won’t know about any current defects, so finding out if there are any falls squarely on you.&nbsp;

To do this, you’ll need to order some inspections. For all of my clients, I recommend they order a home inspection, pest inspection, roof report, and—depending on the home’s amenities—a chimney or pool inspection. All of these will cost between $800 and $1,000, but the information you gain from them is well worth it.&nbsp;
