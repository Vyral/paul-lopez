When it comes time for your mortgage lender to submit your documentation to the underwriting department, it can take anywhere from three to four weeks for them to come up with a decision. When you’re going through this process, the lender may come back to you and ask for additional documentation or to resubmit prior documents. Keep in mind that you’re asking the bank to lend you a large amount of money and they want to get as much documentation as they need in order to process the loan.

**You’ve taken a lot of time to research and carefully select the property you want to call home or a property that you want to invest in.** Whatever the case may be, you want to make sure you take these four rules into account so your loan process goes as smooth as possible:

**1\. Don’t change employment.** There are certain circumstances that come up where you feel that it’s time to leave your job and look for a new one. However, when your loan is in the underwriting process for the purchase of a home, stay exactly where you are financially until after closing.

**2\. Avoid using your credit cards as much as possible.** At the same time, don’t close any cards or open up any new lines of credit. It’s not a good idea.

**3\. Avoid making any large purchases.** It can be tempting to buy a new car or new furniture if you need it, but it should be avoided until after the loan is funded. These purchases could result in the denial of your loan or the end of your transaction.

**4\. Don’t open, close, or transfer bank accounts.** Your loan officer has already taken your current financial picture into consideration, so it’s wise to keep it exactly where it is through the underwriting process. This underwriting time frame can be difficult to deal with, but in the end, it’s a very rewarding experience.
