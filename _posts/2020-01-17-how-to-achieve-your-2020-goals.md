Welcome to 2020\! Now is a great time to take a moment and think about the events that will happen this year. Today I want to share three key tips that will make this a more successful, productive, and prosperous year for you.

**The first thing you should do is take a look at the next 11 months before you.** Remember that the end of the year is filled with holidays and events. Plan out the year according to the calendar and the events that will happen this year.

**Next, take a closer look at the goals you want to achieve in 2020.** Find out what brings meaning to the activities that you do every day like showing up to your job and prospecting, and how it all brings meaning to your purpose. When you look at your purpose, how does that relate to the goals you want to achieve in 2020? When it comes time to accomplish your goals, I encourage you to be truly present in your daily work.

**Finally, if you know that you’re going to buy, sell, or invest in 2020, the time to start planning is now.** Once again, keep the end in mind and the various steps that it will take to get you there.
