Our current market conditions offer a unique set of circumstances. For one thing, interest rates are still at historic lows. This makes buying a home quite affordable.

Before you can take advantage of these circumstances, however, you’ll need to choose a loan officer to work with. So, should you choose a local professional, or will you work with a big bank?&nbsp;

There’s actually no one-size-fits-all answer. For some, working with a big bank (like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, or Capital One) may be the right way to go. For others, working with an independent loan officer may be best.&nbsp;

This is where I come in. My team and I have the tools, knowledge, and experience to help you determine which option is best for your personal opportunity.&nbsp;

Regardless of which route you go, though, the loan officer you work with must be able to fulfill a few specific criteria:

1. **They must be strong communicators.** The person, or team, you choose to work with should be willing and able to stay in touch with you throughout the process.&nbsp;
2. **They must be a team player.** There are many different professionals involved in the real estate process. Your loan officer must be willing to work and communicate with all of them to keep your deal moving smoothly.&nbsp;
3. **They must be skilled and resourceful.** It goes without saying that you should only trust true experts to help you navigate the financial side of a real estate deal.&nbsp;
