When listing your home, the best way to prepare it for the market and make sure it gets sold quickly and for top dollar is to think like a buyer. 

To think like a buyer, you need to know that buyers are primarily concerned with three factors during their home search: price, location, and condition. Although you can’t change your home’s location, you can do something about its price and condition. 

When it comes to pricing your home, remember that you’re in a competitive situation. In other words, **price it according to all of the other comparable homes on the market in your area that you’re competing against**. If it’s in the $500,000 price range, how does it stack up against all the other homes in that price range with similar features?

**As far as condition goes, look at your home from both a structural and cosmetic standpoint.** If you plan on selling within the next three to six months, think about your return on investment in terms of which repairs and upgrades to make. I wouldn’t recommend spending tens of thousands of dollars on renovations; it’s better to make the kinds of improvements that will appeal to buyers in the shortest amount of time.

**The best thing you can do to make sure your home is in top condition is to get it professionally cleaned**. Buyers want to be able to visualize living in your home, and this allows them to do that. Cleaning your home for the market is a fine art and a developed skill, though, so make sure you hire a professional to do the job.

If you’re worried that your home doesn’t appeal to the buyers in our market, don’t be. That’s where a Realtor such as myself comes into play. I can walk through your home, determine what its key selling points are, and develop a marketing plan to emphasize those points. 

If you’d like to schedule a walk-through appointment for your home or you have any other questions about how to sell it quickly and for top dollar, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
