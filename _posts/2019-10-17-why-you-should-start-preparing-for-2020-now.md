Three months from now, 2019 will be over and we’ll be into 2020. That makes right now the perfect time to start thinking about your goals for the new year and finish up some of your goals from 2019.

If you’re doing any financial planning and thinking about refinancing or buying a home, you should know that interest rates are still incredibly low right now. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage can be had for around 3.5% interest, while 15-year terms can be had for around 3%. Now is a great time to check up on your current mortgage to see if you can save from these changes.

Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up. Have you budgeted for these holidays? If not, it’s a good idea to do so now.

Finally, is your home ready to withstand the winter months? Check your exterior to make sure there are no cracks, and make sure your gutters are clean and in proper working order.

If you have a plan to buy or sell a home in 2020, don’t hesitate to reach out to me and give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to offer my expertise to hopefully prepare you. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>&nbsp;
