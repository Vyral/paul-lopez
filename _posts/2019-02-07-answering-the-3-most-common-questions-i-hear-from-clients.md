Over the last 18 years, I’ve answered countless questions from homebuyers and sellers about the real estate market and about real estate in general. I recently sat down to answer three of the most common questions I’m asked on a daily basis and share my expert opinion on each of them. **Here’s an outline of the questions I answered in this video, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the question(s) that interest you most:**

0:50- Is it a good time to buy a home right now?<br>4:32- Is it a good time to sell a home right now?<br>7:08- What geographical areas do my team and I cover in California?

I hope you found the answers to these common questions helpful. **No matter what your situation is, we’re always happy to help you achieve your real estate goals.** If you have any additional questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out. I would love to hear from you.
