<br>Let’s pretend you’re a seller and we’re at your kitchen table discussing your latest offer. The subject of inspections comes up. **Depending on where your property is located, each county in the area has its own customary practices for handling them.&nbsp;**

In some counties, it’s customary for the seller to obtain all the inspections prior to putting the home on the market. In other counties, it’s customary for the buyer to obtain the inspections once the property is already under contract and in the escrow period.

**Typically, there will be three to four necessary inspections:**

1\. General home inspection<br>2\. Termite inspection<br>3\. Roof inspection<br>4\. Chimney inspection (if applicable)<br>5\. Pool inspection (if applicable)

In the counties where these inspections are obtained prior to placing the home on the market, it provides a lot of good information on the sales price that is set for your home. It gives the buyer the chance to completely understand the true condition of your home prior to placing an offer on it.&nbsp;

In the counties where the buyer obtains the inspection in the escrow period, new information is revealed after these inspections are obtained and it will probably lead to a second round of negotiations on the sale of your home.

**One more inspection that will probably come up is an appraisal.** An appraisal is only required if a buyer is using financing to purchase a home. The goal of the appraiser is to make sure that the home meets the minimum value requirement for the type of financing that will be obtained. If the value doesn’t come in, there could be yet another round of negotiations on the home.

There’s a lot of information to know about inspections and appraisals, but it’s all easy information to navigate through if you and I sit down and have a detailed conversation about the best strategy for your situation.
