If you’re thinking about making a move in real estate—whether it be to buy, sell, or rent a property—choosing the right agent is an invaluable aspect of your future success. Today I’ll discuss three factors to consider in an agent to help you make sure you’re hiring the very best professional help for your next transaction:

* **Consider their experience.** There are many steps in the real estate process, and some potential issues are predictable while others are not. Agents with experience in these matters will help get you through the process with a little stress as possible.
* **Consider their communication skills.** The best agent to hire is one who will do their best to proactively communicate with you to keep you up to date on the transaction. This may occur via phone, email, or text—whichever works best to keep them in consistent contact with you.
* **Do you have a connection with them?** Does your agent really understand you and your family’s needs? Do they truly get why it’s important for you to succeed in your transaction? A great agent will take the time to connect with you and make sure they’re working in your best interests.
