Whether you’re buying your very first home, selling your current home and buying another one, or are considering real estate as an investment strategy, your first order of business will be to organize your finances. There are three main steps you must take to do so.&nbsp;

First, **check your credit report.** Whether you have perfect credit or your credit score needs work, you should take advantage of the many resources available to consumers such as yourself. Checking your credit doesn’t affect your credit score, but it’s a great place to start because you can find out exactly what’s being reported. And if you discover any errors, you have plenty of time to correct them.&nbsp;

Second, **consider where your down payment and closing costs are coming from** (and remember that these are two separate things). You’ll want to know how much funds you’ll have to work with and where you’ll access these funds. Perhaps they’ll come from a savings account, or perhaps from a 401(k) or retirement plan. In the latter case, you’ll want to talk to your funds advisor sooner rather than later so you can learn the rules for using that money for your home purchase. The same applies if you’ve gone through a life-changing event (e.g., getting divorced or receiving an inheritance).

When it comes to organizing your finances, **make sure you meet with an experienced mortgage professional**—one who’ll sit down with you and take the time to fully understand your financial situation and your prospective home purchase. They’ll outline how much your down payment, closing costs, and monthly mortgage payments will be.&nbsp;

Buying a home is an emotionally charged transaction, and there are many steps you’ll go through to complete the transaction. With the right team behind you, though, this transaction can be seamless and quite enjoyable.&nbsp;
