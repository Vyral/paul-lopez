As a homebuyer, what steps must you take to ensure you find the right home for you and your family?

**First, choose an experienced Real Estate Broker to work with.** It’s important to start with this task because a good Real Estate Broker will help formulate your strategy. When it comes to buying a home, no two scenarios are exactly alike, which means there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Your Real Estate Broker will guide you through the process, remind you of your original objectives, and make sure you meet them.&nbsp;

When it comes to selecting a home to purchase, I recommend thinking of it as a process of elimination. You don’t want to miss out on anything available, so begin by identifying which cities you want to live in. This will narrow down to several different factors, including your buying power, budget, and the location of these cities with respect to your daily commute.&nbsp;

After you’ve settled on one city, narrow your focus further to the neighborhoods of that city. This will be determined by factors such as school districts, shopping centers, your work commute, etc.&nbsp;

**Once you’ve decided on the neighborhoods you’d like to live in, it’s time to amp up your research, especially online.** You’ll want to talk to different people who live in these neighborhoods to really get a sense of whether they’re ideal for your family.&nbsp;

When you’ve decided on a single neighborhood, it’s time to visit open houses in the area. Open houses are a great way to view homes—you can spend as much time as you want looking around inside and considering all the amenities the home has to offer.&nbsp;

Meanwhile, you should be communicating with your Real Estate Broker the information you’ve discovered and how it applies to your situation. They can get different estimates for you and advise you on any neighborhood information that’s not public information.&nbsp;

After you talk to your Real Estate Broker, schedule in-person visits to the homes on your short list. You started big, but now you’ve narrowed your search all the way down to the homes you may want to make an offer on. It’s during this point your Realtor should remind you of your original objectives and make sure the homes you see in person will meet your needs.&nbsp;

**I’ve employed this strategy for close to 20 years, and it’s one of the most effective ways to find a home that meets the needs of your family.**&nbsp; After all is said and done, you and your Real Estate Broker will write a strong offer and, if it’s accepted, begin closing on your new home.&nbsp;
